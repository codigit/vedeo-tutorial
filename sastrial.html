               Four score and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation or any other nation so conceived and so dedicate can long endure.

                   We advance thinkers owe our present imunity, such as it is very largely to the fact that even those of our present generation who where formerlt quite against us, have nevertheless being moving, if less rapidly or explicitly in the same direction as ourselve. In their heart, they do not believe we are essentially wrong, but they think we go too far, dangerously and presumtuously too far. But what we live for, our sort is to go too far for the pedestrian contingent.

               We cannot consecrate we cannot dedicate, we can not hallow this ground, the brave men living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little not what we say here, but can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living rather to be here dedicated to the unfinished work which they who fought here have done far so nobly advance, it is rather for us to be dedicated that from this honuored dead we shall take increase devotion to that cause to which they gave their last full measure of devotion. And that we here highly resolve that this dead shall not have died in vain and that this notion under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that the government of the poeple for the people and by the people shall not perish on the earth.
